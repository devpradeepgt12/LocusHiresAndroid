# LocusHiresAndroid
This project is created to demonstrate to multi item recycler view based on dynamic JSON and developed using latest best practices and MVVM design patter with unit tests coverage.

This assignment was immersive and vast in terms of development covering a lot of basic android concepts. I enjoyed working on it.

The salient features of the development done is as follows,
- Original, The code written from scratch
- It is completed with MVVM design pattern best practices.
- Data binding concepts included
- Unit tests are included but whole project tests are not covered as it would have a lot of time. The goal I worked here was demonstration of unit tests.
